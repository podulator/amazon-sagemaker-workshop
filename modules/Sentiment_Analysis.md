## Sentiment Analysis 

In this module, we'll train and test a Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification) model on SageMaker using SageMaker's prebuilt Deep Learning containers. These containers are available for TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch, and Chainer. 

With this approach, you simply bring your own Python training script, and SageMaker handles the rest.  All of this is simplied using the conveniences provided by the [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk), which abstracts away many of the low level details of setting up training jobs and endpoints.   

Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Jupyter notebooks homepage 

2. Click into the folder called `amazon-sagemaker-workshop`

3. Click into the folder called `notebooks`

4. Click on the notebook called `sentiment-analysis.ipynb`, then follow the directions in the notebook.

<p><strong>NOTE:  training the model for this example typically takes about 5 minutes.</strong></p>
