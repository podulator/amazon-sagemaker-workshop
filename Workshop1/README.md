# Predicting the future with Amazon SageMaker

## Modules

This workshop is divided into 2 modules, and you can do them in any order.

- Structured Data Use Case #1:  Videogame Sales 

- Structured Data Use Case #2:  Predicting Customer Churn

## Structured Data Use Case #1:  Videogame Sales

In this module, we'll use Amazon SageMaker's built-in version of XGBoost to make predictions based on structured data related to the videogame industry.

When you're finished, return here to move on to the next module.  

## Structured Data Use Case #2:  Predicting Customer Churn

This module also uses Amazon SageMaker's built-in version of the XGBoost algorithm, and in it we will be predicting a customers likelyhood of churning, based on data from the telecoms industry.
