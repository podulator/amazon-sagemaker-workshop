## Containers

In this module, we'll create our own deep learning container for Amazon SageMaker. Ones already exist for TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch, and Chainer, but sometimes you need extra dependencies (in this case we add OpenCV Computer Vision libraries), or a different framework altogether, and this will show you how to use Amazon SageMakwer in a modular way. We will create a single image that is used for both training and hosting the model.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Jupyter notebooks homepage 

2. Click into the folder called `amazon-sagemaker-workshop`

3. Click into the folder called `notebooks`

4. Click on the notebook called `tf-byom.ipynb`, then follow the directions in the notebook.

<p><strong>NOTE:  training the model for this example typically takes about 5 minutes.</strong></p>
