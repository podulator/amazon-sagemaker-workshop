## Image Classification With Transfer Learning


For this module, we'll work with an image classification example notebook. In particular, we'll use Amazon SageMaker's built-in image classification algorithm, which is a supervised learning algorithm that takes an image as input and classifies it into one of multiple output categories. 

It uses a convolutional neural network (ResNet) that can be trained from scratch, or trained using transfer learning.  The technique of transfer learning is useful when a large number of training images are not available. Even if you don't have experience with neural networks or image classification, SageMaker's image classification algorithm makes the technology easy to use, with no need to design and set up your own neural network.  

Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Jupyter notebooks homepage 

2. Click into the folder called `amazon-sagemaker-workshop`

3. Click into the folder called `notebooks`

4. Click on the notebook called `Image-classification-transfer-learning.ipynb`, then follow the directions in the notebook.

<p><strong>NOTE:  training the model for this example typically takes about 10 minutes.</strong> However, keep in mind that this is relatively short because transfer learning is used rather than training from scratch, which could take many hours.</p>
