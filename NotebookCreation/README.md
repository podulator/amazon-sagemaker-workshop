# Creating a Notebook Instance

## Configure the Notebook Instance

1. Make sure you are on the AWS Management Console home page.  
In the **Find Services** search box, type **SageMaker**.  The search result list will populate with Amazon SageMaker, which you should now click.  This will bring you to the Amazon SageMaker console homepage.

6. In the **Permissions and encryption** section, choose **Create a new role** in the **IAM role** drop down menu.  

In the resulting pop-up modal, select **None** under **S3 Buckets you specify â€“ optional**. 
We will use the default bucket that SageMaker creates for us, which is allowed by the permissions list with the green ticks next to them, 
basically, anything with 'sagemaker' in the name or as a tag.

Click **Create role**.
