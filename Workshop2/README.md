# Image recognition with Amazon SageMaker


## Modules

This workshop is divided into 2 modules, and you can do them in any order.

- Computer Vision Use Case #1:  Image Classification with Transfer Learning

- Computer Vision Use Case #2:  Advanced Image Classification With Automatic Tuning

## Computer Vision Use Case #1:  Image Classification with Transfer Learning

This module uses Amazon SageMaker's built-in Image Classification algorithm. 

Please go to the following link for this module:  [**Image Classification with Transfer Learning**](../modules/Image_Classification_Transfer_Learning.md).  

When you're finished, return here to move on to the next module.  

## Computer Vision Use Case #2:  Advanced Image Classification With Automatic Tuning

This module uses Amazon SageMaker's built-in Image Classification algorithm, but adds auto tuning and Elastic Inference to it for better, cost optimised, results.

Please go to the following link for this module:  [**Advanced Image Classification With Automatic Tuning**](../modules/Advanced_Image_Classification_With_Automatic_Tuning.md).  

When you're finished, return here and go on to the Cleanup Guide.  

## Cleanup
